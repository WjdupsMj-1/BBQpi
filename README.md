## Project Description  
  This project is based on a Spring 2013 Civil Engineering Class Project that makes use of the RaspberryPi computer platform
and a pair of MAX6675 K-type thermocouple amplifiers in order to make temperature measurements that can be monitored via a network.  The hardware also makes use of a 16x2 LCD screen and relays to allow local temperature monitoring and the possible temperature control.  

## Requirements
### Hardware
* RapsberryPi single board computer model A or B with powersupply and SSD card
* 2 MAX6675 Thermocouple Amplifiers
* 2 K-Type Thermocouples
* Network Connection (Wifi Dongle or Ethernet)

### Software
* Python 2.7 and web.py
* Software with Twitter API support (If twitter alerts desired)
* Possibly other dependencies to be documented

## Software Components
* List to include components, file name, and funcitons.

## Installation Instructions
* List to include installation instructions and tips.
